## Databases

Click over to the **Sample database** to see a database in action. Use **Views** to see the same data represented in a table, a board, a list, or a gallery.

Each database can have any number of properties. There are nine different types of properties:

1. text
2. number
3. **select** - one of any number of user-defined options. Used for board views.
4. **multiselect** - like select, but it supports choosing any number of options. Not used for board views.
5. date
6. checkbox
7. url
8. email
9. phone

You can create any number of views by clicking on the view selector at the top left corner of the database. Within each view, any number of properties can be displayed.

In a board, drag and drop cards to assign the grouping select property.
